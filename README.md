# Quantifying Multipolar Polarization
by Christian Weidemann

This repository contains the code for my bachelor project, and enables reproduction of findings and visualizations. 

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a quantitative measure for assessing multipolar polarization in a given system. The code in this repository implements various algorithms and techniques to analyze and quantify the level of polarization in multipolar systems.

## Installation

To use this code, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. To install the required dependencies with windows command prompt, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
